# Geometrylib


This is a programming project to automate the calculation of geometric problems. This tool is as of March 2023 still very experimental and very limited in scope. It uses the python Sympy library as a backend for the calculations. Currently it only supports basically lines, circles and points. Nothing more. Feel free to add features to it if you want and file a request. To run: just type python3 geometrylib.py . If you want to run a file then just type python3 geometrylib.py --file [your command file here] .
